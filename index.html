                Hamza and Sarah were absolutely convinced they were living a 90s love story. They'd binge-watch "Friends," pretend their Spotify playlists were carefully curated mixtapes, and text each other with actual T9 abbreviations—"LOL" felt so much more authentic when you had to press a button three times to get an "L."

One afternoon, they decided to go all-in on the 90s vibe. They dressed up in flannel shirts, Sarah threw on a scrunchie, and Hamza rocked a bucket hat like it was 1995. They took a disposable camera (well, a filter on their phones, but it counted) and went for a walk in the park, pretending to wait days to see how their photos turned out.

When they saw an old payphone, Hamza ran over, picked up the receiver, and pretended to call Sarah, who stood three feet away. "Hey, girl, it's Hamza. I’m using 10 of my 20 prepaid minutes, so you know it’s real."

They sat on a park bench, sharing a bag of M&M's and talking about "the future" like they weren’t just deciding what to order for dinner. Everything was perfect until Sarah's phone buzzed, and without thinking, she asked, "Should we Uber back?"

Their 90s dream bubble popped instantly. Hamza sighed, "Yeah... or we could, you know, take a cab like real 90s kids."

But as they ordered their ride, they laughed, knowing that even if they couldn’t fully escape their generation, their love story was still pretty rad.
